### Problems
- Zoom slider becomes more jumpy when the font size increases
- Gameboard could technically be 36 * 36 but board starts to jump when the game is operated by keyboard

### Todo
- Save gameLevel instead of mineCount with boardCode,
- Test new code

### Features
- Make navbar sticky in landscape screen
- Make header of hiscores sticky
- Playmode: Play without flags
- Playmode: Win or loose when flag count equals mine count
